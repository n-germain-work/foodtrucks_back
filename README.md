# Node.js / Express template

This template provides:

- A basic Express app in `app.js`
- `dotenv`, a sample env file (`.env.sample`)
- ESLint with Airbnb rules
- Prettier
- Automatic linting on commit: **you can't commit if you have ESLint errors**

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: `npm install` (alternatively, you can use Yarn or PNPM)
2. Copy `.env.sample` as `.env` and adjust it to your needs
3. Start the app on your local machine: `npm run dev`
